		<p>iPod is a line of portable media players. The product line-up currently consists of the hard drive-based iPod classic, the touchscreen iPod touch, the compact iPod nano, and the ultra-compact iPod shuffle. iPod classic models store media on an internal hard drive, while all other models use flash memory to enable their smaller size. As with many other digital music players, iPods can also serve as external data storage devices. Storage capacity varies by model, ranging from 2 GB for the iPod shuffle to 160 GB for the iPod classic. </p>
